            <p class="item">I am a web-developer based in Sydney. I grind HTML/CSS to weld with JS frameworks
                into beautiful and efficient websites/web-apps. Everything started with a passion for the technologies.
                Got the master degree in IT before I got the opportunity to move to Australia.</p>
            <!-- <p>My passion for technology and programming never subsided, So I took a bold decision and said Good-bye to
                old job and joined General Assembly to brush-up my skills and now ready to come back to Industry</p> -->
            <p>I love to visit historic place and reading about them. Photography at natural places give me wowww
                fealing. Clicked some beautiful pics of wildlife. Will soon add those all here.</p>
            <p>While I'm not studying/working, I often find myself playing chess or badminton with my mates. if not
                anythig else, then Playing Age Of Empire (Guilty pleasure)</p>
